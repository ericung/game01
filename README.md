# game01

A simple game where there are two opponents and two modes - free for all and reach the objective.
Once the basis of this game is completed, the next version will have more game modes, more rules,
customizable units, sprites, and more. 
The overall objective of this simple game is to have players think outside the box when they are inside of the box.
